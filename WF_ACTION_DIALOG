WF
a workflow requires always a record as starting point (created, updated, deleted or on-demand)

ACTION  -  business logic !! 
an action DOES NOT  require a record
In addition to the steps that can be used for real-time workflows, actions also have the Assign Value step. In actions, 
these can be used only to set output arguments. You can use the form assistant to set output arguments to specific values or, more likely,
to values from the record that the action is running against, 
records related to that record with a many-to-one relationship, records created in an earlier step, or values that are part of the process itself.

EXAMPLE
if you had the requirement of when an account or contact gets reassigned we need to send an email to the newly assigned person and then create a task to follow up for 
this person in 5 days. In this case this would be two seperate processes; one for the account entity and one for the contact entity. 
Instead of having the same logic duplicated in both of these workflows; i'd rather build a simple action that does this sending of email + creation of task.
I'd then take the new action and execute it from each workflows.
