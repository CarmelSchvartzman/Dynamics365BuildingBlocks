SOLUTION:
export and transfer items from one CRM to another instance

MANAGED:
if you uninstall the managed solution, all fields and forms and web resources (= all customizations) 
you added to the system with this solution will be also deleted. ALSO the data will be deleted!!
The advantage of a managed solution is, that no user can remove components or change the solution.
CAN BE ROLLED BACK!!



UNMANAGED:
customizations are written to the system like you have done them manually. This means after uninstalling an unmanaged solution, nothing happens. All customizations are still in the system. This is helpful to transfer you customizations but may offer problems, if you would like to roll back to the state before you installed the solution.
