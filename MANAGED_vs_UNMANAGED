SOLUTION:
export and transfer items from one CRM to another instance

MANAGED:
if you uninstall the managed solution, all fields and forms and web resources (= all customizations) 
you added to the system with this solution will be also deleted. ALSO the data will be deleted!!
The advantage of a managed solution is, that no user can remove components or change the solution.
CAN BE ROLLED BACK!!
 If you have multiple Managed solutions customising the same component, you need to follow LIFO (last in first out)
            process to remove components.  With Unmanaged, you can simply delete the component from the system.  
 Using Managed solutions doesn’t mean the components in the solution can’t be customised: can’t be customised using the same solution
                         but they can be customised using another solution. 

UNMANAGED:
customizations are written to the system like you have done them manually. 
This means after uninstalling an unmanaged solution, nothing happens. All customizations are still in the system. 
if you would like to roll back to the state before you installed the solution.
Unmanaged solution import will overwrite the existing customisations of components.
