Roll Up Field:  CHILDREN

The rollups are calculated by scheduled system jobs that run asynchronously in the background.
A rollup field contains an aggregate value computed over the records related to a specified record
The roll up fields comprise of Aggregation that use the fields from the current entity or related child entities.
Wide selection of aggregate functions. You can aggregate data by using the following functions: SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAXand AVG


Calculated Field:  PARENTS

Data is calculated as soon as form is loaded
calculated fields let you automate manual calculations used in your business processes.
The calculated fields comprise of calculations that use the fields from the current entity or related parent entities.
ADDHOURS, ADDDAYS, ADDWEEKS, ADDMONTHS, ADDYEARS, SUBTRACTHOURS, SUBTRACTDAYS, SUBTRACTWEEKS, SUBTRACTMONTHS,
SUBTRACTYEARS, DIFFINDAYS, DIFFINHOURS, DIFFINMINUTES, DIFFINMONTHS, DIFFINWEEKS, DIFFINYEARS, CONCAT, TRIMLEFT, and TRIMRIGHT.

Rollup field considerations
You should be aware of certain conditions and restrictions when working with rollup fields:

You can define a maximum of 100 rollup fields for the organization and up to 10 rollup fields per entity.

A workflow can’t be triggered by the rollup field updates.

A workflow wait condition cannot use a rollup field.

A rollup over the rollup field is not supported.

A rollup can't reference a calculated field that uses another calculated field, even if all the fields of the other calculated field are on the current entity.

The rollup can only apply filters to the source entity or related entities, simple fields or non-complex calculated fields.

A rollup can be done only over related entities with the 1:N relationship. A rollup can’t be done over the N:N relationships.

A rollup can’t be done over the 1:N relationship for the Activity entity or the Activity Party entity.

The business rules, workflows or calculated fields always use the last calculated value of the rollup field.

A rollup field is aggregated under the system user context. All users are able to see the same rollup field value. You can control the rollup field visibility with the field level security (FLS), by restricting who can access the rollup field. More information: Field level security.
