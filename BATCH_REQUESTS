https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/webapi/execute-batch-operations-using-web-api

You can group multiple operations into a single HTTP request using a batch operation. These operations will be performed sequentially in the order they are specified.
The value that batch requests provide is that they can include change sets, which provide a way to bundle a number of operations that either succeed or fail as a group.
Remember that associated entities can be created in a single operation more easily than using a batch request. Batch requests are best used when performing operations on entities that aren't associated with each other when all the operations must be performed in a single transactional operation.

Batch requests can contain up to 1000 individual requests and cannot contain other batch requests.

URLs for GET requests sent with a batch are limited to 32768 characters.
