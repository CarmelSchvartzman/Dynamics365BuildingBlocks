CUSTOM WF :

IF:
simple tasks : such as sending an e-mail or creating / updating assigning records OR  allow an advanced user to make changes to logic
OR the logic should be available to be run on demand OR you want to send emails making use of templates and attaching files

Always run in the context of owner of  workflow
Can run for long time
Can run on demand
User can track progress
Canâ€™t run offline
Real Time Workflow (NOT BACKGROUND) has TRANSACTION

PROCESS WF :

Workflows are always post operation.

Regarding to security:

Workflows triggered automatically will run under the security context of the workflow owner. 
On the contrary, if executed ONDEMAND, the security context of the user who executed the workflow will be used.

Plug-ins execute under the security context of the CRM Web application pool identity (typically NETWORK SERVICE). 
As this account typically maps to generic CRM SYSTEM user this typically works fine.
