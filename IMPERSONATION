Impersonation Code
Easy way to impersonate System User is to pass null to the CreateOrganizationService and it will run as System user, find out more in this CRM SDK article

// Use the factory to generate the Organization Service.
OrganizationServiceImpersonated = factory.CreateOrganizationService(null);

You can pass in a different user Id to the CreateOrganizationService to create an IOrganizationService

IOrganizationServiceFactory factory = (IOrganizationServiceFactory)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof IOrganizationServiceFactory));
IOrganizationService service = factory.CreateOrganizationService(context.InitiatingUserId);

The sample code in the CRM SDK article impersonates using OrganizationServiceContext.  I personally have used this
